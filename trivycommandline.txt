trivy image nginx:1.23.2-perl

The scan will begin by updating the vulnerability database, which takes around one minute. 
Shortly after, a flood of scan results is displayed.

Each result includes the following columns from left to right:

    Library: The name of the library or package that contains the vulnerability
    Vulnerability: The identifier of the vulnerability in the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database
    Severity: The severity of the vulnerability as determined by the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score and categorized into UNKNOWN, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and CRITICAL
    Installed Version: The version of the library or package that is installed in the image
    Fixed Version: The version of the library or package that fixes the vulnerability
    Title: The title of the vulnerability and a link to more details

Reissuing the same command: 
trivy image nginx:1.23.2-perl 

  The vulnerability database is cached and the command completes much faster the second time.

You will have to determine what level of severity is acceptable for your organization. 
You can filter the vulnerabilites by severity using the --severity option.

  trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL nginx:1.23.2-perl

  The list of vulnerabilities is much shorter and only includes the vulnerabilities that are of high or critical severity. 
  As time goes on, new vulnerabilities are discovered and the list may grow. 
  That is why it is important to keep periodically scan your images to have a current understanding of risk.

trivy image nginx:1.23.2-alpine
 	
 	The scan results are much shorter because the alpine image is based on a much smaller base image containing fewer libraries and packages. 
  The alpine image is said to have a smaller attack surface than the perl image.

trivy image --format json --output /home/ubuntu/nginx.json nginx:1.23.2-alpine

  Save the scan results to a JSON file for future analysis.
